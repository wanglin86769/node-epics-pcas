# Site-specific settings for the linux-x86_64 target

# NOTE: In most cases if SHARED_LIBRARIES is set to YES the
# shared libraries will be found automatically.  However if the .so
# files are installed at a different path to their compile-time path
# then in order to be found at runtime do one of these:
# a) LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include the full absolute pathname to
#    $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) when invoking base
#    executables.
# b) Add the runtime path to SHRLIB_DEPLIB_DIRS and PROD_DEPLIB_DIRS, which
#    will add the named directory to the list contained in the executables.
# c) Add the runtime path to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig
#    to inform the system of the shared library location.


# Use GNU Readline if the header file is installed

# If libreadline needs additional libraries to be linked with it, try
# uncommenting each of the lines below in turn, starting with the top
